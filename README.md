# EarthAntipodes
The program concentrates on accepting a street address, a city or a state as an input and retrieves the respective coordinates of the starting point constituting the latitude and longitude. 
It then calculates the antipode latitude and longitude for the starting location and reverse tracks the city or region based on the antipode coordinates. 
There is a high probability of the destination coordinates belonging to water bodies as almost 71% of the Earthâ€™s surface is water.
